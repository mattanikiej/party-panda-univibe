## What is Univibe?
Univibe is an exciting effect with loads of ways to use it. It's some of the most interesting modulation that's been super popularized by guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix. The original Univibe pedal was made to emulate a doppler effect of a radio transmission coming in and out. It pairs amazingly with some distortion before it for a classic 60s and 70s rock sound. It also works amazingly with clean tones for vibey soundscapes.

## Files Supported
Currently **Party Panda** is only available as a **VST3** or **AU** plugin, which is supported by most types of DAWs. It also works as a standalone app without the need for a DAW. It has not been tested or compiled as an AAX file for Pro Tools, but it should build and work if you have the license and SDK.

## Build
This plugin is built using the JUCE framework. See their [repository](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) or [website](https://juce.com/) for instructions on downloading and building projects with Projucer. Once the project is built, move the AU or VST3 file where those files are generally installed on your machine.

Some tips for development:
The [JUCE Plugin Tutorial Part 1](https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_create_projucer_basic_plugin.html) has a very good tutorial on how to set up their host to connect to the plugin. This is extremely useful as it becomes much easier to use your IDE's debugger, and you're not reliant on a DAW to hear your plugin.
